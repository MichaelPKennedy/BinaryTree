# BinaryTree
BinaryTree.java is a binary tree coded from scratch, with a recursive insert method, an iterative insert method, search method, height method, and an inOrder method which traverses the tree and adds the key values to an array in numeric order. The order could then be printed in reverse order via this array. The BinaryTreeSortExample.java demonstrates the tree by inserting 1 million nodes into the tree with randomly generated key values using the recursive insert method. The number 7 is then searched for using the search method, the height of the tree is printed, and the run time of the recursive insert is also printed.
